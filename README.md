# Decision-Tree-based-Classification
Classify handwritten numerical data (MNIST) with decision trees and Random Forest Based classifiermoo

The purpose of this project is to implement a decision tree-based classifiers for hand-written digit recognition. The project consists of multiple components that involve using different representations of the dataset, implementing two classification models, assessing the performance of each classifier with the different representations and different stopping criteria, and analyzing some of the models that were estimated. 

"rep1" is the original MNIST dataset, "rep2" is generated by projecting the data points to the first 20 principal components of the original training dataset. For each representation, there is a training set and a test set


There are two classification implementations, one is based on decision trees with gini index as the purity measure while the other uses random forest as an ensemble method with 100 trees
